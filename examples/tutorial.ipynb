    "We initialize the `LymphoMNIST` dataset, detailing parameters like the root directory, data type (training), and transformations. Aimed at advancing medical imaging, this dataset focuses on lymphocyte segmentation and classification. Specifying `num_classes` is optional; by default, or if no parameter is passed, three classes (`B`, `T4`, `T8` cells) will be loaded. For `num_classes=3`, it loads these three classes, and for `num_classes=2`, it loads `B` and `T` cells by merging `T4` and `T8` into same class.\n",

This section introduces a method to manipulate and visually inspect the images within the `LymphoMNIST` dataset. Through the use of `matplotlib`, we provide a practical approach to plot a grid of images directly from the data loader, allowing for a quick and informative overview of the dataset's content.\n",

Whether dealing with color or grayscale images, the function adjusts to display each sample appropriately, ensuring a comprehensive view of the dataset's diversity.\n",
